Overview

This project is a React-based UI that creates an engaging welcome experience with interactive and animated visuals. The main interface is built using modular components and styled using custom CSS for a modern, animated look.

ðŸ”§ Components Overview

Underline: Renders a subtle horizontal line to enhance visual hierarchy.
Hero: Displays a central circular "WELCOME!!" badge with bold text.
Shadow: Sits behind the hero badge with a blurred animation (spin) for a glowing, dynamic effect.
HeroWrapper: Combines the Hero and Shadow components in a bordered circular container with a radial gradient background.
BtnContainer: Holds two interactive buttons (Browse Test Data and Connect Domain) with hover animations, and displays a disclaimer for free-tier users.
OuterBox: The main layout container styled with shadows, padding, and responsive alignment. It wraps the entire content and gives the app a centered, clean layout.

ðŸŽ¨ Styling Highlights

Animation: A custom @keyframes spin animation gives the shadow around the welcome badge a floating, orbit-like motion.
Responsive Flexbox Layouts: Most containers use flex for clean and adaptive alignment.
Hover Effects: Buttons scale up smoothly on hover, enhancing interactivity.
Visual Hierarchy: Typography and spacing are used to guide the user's attention â€” starting with a bold heading, then to the welcome badge, and finally to the action buttons
